    <h1 id="rules_title">Exaination Regulations</h1>
    <h2>Enrolment</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>When started a semester, the student is automatically registered for the tests or indicative assessments for that semester.</li>
        <li>This will not apply, however, if the student is prevented by illness or maternity from taking the test</li>
        <li>Students are responsible for ensuring that they are entitled to be registered for a test</li>
        <li>Students will not be permitted to sit the Final Test unless their specialization report has been
            submitted and all other required tests taken and passed.</li>
        <li>A student failing to appear at the semester 7 final project test must prepare a new final project
            and subsequently take the test.
            <br />
            <strong>Withdrawal</strong>
            <br />
            You cannot withdraw from an exam unless in case of documented maternity, illness or similar.
            If you do not attend an exam it will count as 1 exam attempt.</li>

    </ol>
    <div id="text_page">
    <h2>Re-examination</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In the event of failure to pass a test according to the course regulations, the student is registered
            for a new test or resit the same test</li>
        <li>The resit must if possible be held before the start of the next semester, if necessary as a Reexamination because of illness or maternity, and no later than the date of the next regular test
            scheduled at VIA University College, School of Technology and Business</li>
        <li>A student who has been notified of a new date for the test must no later than ten days before the
            due date confirm that he/she will attend</li>
        <li>A student may be register for the same test three times. In exceptional circumstances VIA University College, School of Technology and Business may permit up to further attempts. In such cases
            the student must submit a detailed, reasoned application for exemption. Lack of scholastic aptitude will not constitute exceptional circumstances.</li>
        <li>A student will be unable to continue with the course unless he/she has passed the semester 2
            tests within two years, calculated from the start of the course.
            s </li>
    </ol>
</div>
    <h2>Illness</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A candidate who has been prevented by certified illness from sitting or completing a test must be
            given the opportunity to resit the test as soon as possible. For this purpose, illness may be proved
            2/3
            by presenting a medical certificate to VIA University College, School of Technology and Business
            no later than two weeks after the original date of the test</li>
        <li>Efforts should be made to resit the examination before the start of the following semester, but
            this requirement may also be satisfied if the student sits the next scheduled test. Students are
            not entitled to start a new semester until the previous semester’s test has been duly passed.</li>
        <li>If this test is scheduled to take place in the final test period of the course, the student must be
            given the opportunity to sit the test during or immediately after that same test period.</li>
        <li>Other special circumstances preventing a candidate from attending the test will be dealt with at
            VIA University College, School of Technology and Business discretion.
        </li>
